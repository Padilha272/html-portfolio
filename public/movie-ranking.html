<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h3>
<p>For me, this is the absolute definition of fantasy,<br>
great characters,amazing soundtrack and a epic ending.</p>
<h3>Blade Runner</h3>
<p>Probably my favourite movie. Great soudtrack,<br>
creative story and a lot of good questions to think after the movie ends.</p>
<h3>Dragon Ball Z: The History of Trunks</h3>
<p>My introduction to animes and to time travel stories.<br> 
The first time i saw the protagonists of the movie not having a good end
and it make want to know what would happen next in the story.</p>
